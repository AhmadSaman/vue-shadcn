# Vue + ShadCN Experiment

This Project is using [ShadCN](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)(vue version) with Vue using the Composition API. The project is built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and other modern tools.

## What is ShadCN?

ShadCN is a collection of accessible and customizable UI components built on top of [Reka UI](https://www.reka-ui.com)([Radix UI](https://www.radix-vue.com/) replacement in Vue) and Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of pre-styled components that you can copy and modify to fit your needs, without being locked into a design system.

### How ShadCN Works
- ShadCN components are not installed as a package but copied directly into your project.
- You can modify and style them however you want since they are not locked behind a library.
- It leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and Radix UI for accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** (Composition API)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Pinia** (State management)
- **Vue Router**
- **Vite** (Build tool)
- **Lucide Vue** (Icons)

## API
I'm using [Platzi Fake Store API](fakeapi.platzi.com) for the API, its a public API developers are using this API at the same time so if a product disappears or you see a strange image or data it's on the API side not mine

## Notes

My thoughts on the ShadCN Vue version: It is decent, but there are some small issues with certain components. However, since it is community-based, improvements and fixes are actively contributed by developers, But **I don't suggest it for Production use**

This is an experimental project to explore how ShadCN integrates with Vue. It is not intended for production use but rather as a learning exercise.

Feel free to explore, modify, and improve the setup!
